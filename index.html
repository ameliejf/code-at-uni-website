								<p> noun </p>
							</div>

							<p> A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. </p>

  				 <div class="tipname"> <p> 1. Patience Is Important </p> </div>

  				<div class ="tipbody"> <p> Don’t sweat the stuff you can’t control. Life is much too short to be angry & annoyed all the time. Did you miss your bus? No worries, there will be another one. ATMs out of money? Great! Take an unplanned road trip over to the next town and explore. Sometimes freakouts happen regardless. </p> </div> 

  				<div class="tipname"> <p> 2. Wake Up Early </p> </div>

  				<div class ="tipbody"> <p> Rise at sunrise to have the best attractions all to yourself while avoiding crowds. It’s also a magical time for photos due to soft diffused light, and usually easier to interact with locals. Sketchy areas are less dangerous in the morning too. Honest hardworking people wake up early; touts, scammers, and criminals sleep in. </p> </div> 
  				

  				<div class="tipname"> <p> 3. Laugh At Yourself </p> </div>

  				<div class ="tipbody"> <p> You will definitely look like a fool many times when traveling to new places. Rather than get embarrassed, laugh at yourself. Don’t be afraid to screw up, and don’t take life so seriously.
				Once a whole bus full of Guatemalans laughed with glee when I forced our driver to stop so I could urgently pee on the side of the road. Returning to the bus and laughing with them gave me new friends for the rest of the journey.
 				</p> </div> 


  				<div class="tipname"> <p> 4. Stash Extra Cash </p> </div>

  				<div class ="tipbody"> <p> Cash is king around the world. To cover your ass in an emergency, make sure to stash some in a few different places. I recommend at least a couple hundred dollars worth. If you lose your wallet, your card stops working, or the ATMs run out of money, you’ll be glad you did.
				Some of my favorite stash spots include socks, under shoe inserts, a toiletry bag, around the frame of a backpack, even sewn behind a patch on your bag </p> </div> 

  				<div class="tipname"> <p> 5. Meet Local People </p> </div>

  				<div class ="tipbody"> <p> Make it a point to avoid other travelers from time to time and start conversations with local people. Basic English is spoken widely all over the world, so it’s easier to communicate with them than you might think, especially when you combine hand gestures and body language.
				Learn from those who live in the country you’re visiting. People enrich your travels more than sights do. </p> </div>
